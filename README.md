# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

In this challenge I refactored the HTML semantics of the code to give more description. I also added alt descriptions to all of the images throughout the index. This was done to make the index more user-friendly so that if someone examined the code they would not have to guess at what they are looking at.

## Installation
